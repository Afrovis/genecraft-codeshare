As a token of gratitude about what I learned from others, I'm open sourcing both my fixed neural network and my simple NEAT implementation. Most likely, both can be improved and optimized. As of July 2024, the NEAT algorithm has a bug and sometimes creates nodes on the same layer. Haven't focussed on fixing that yet.
